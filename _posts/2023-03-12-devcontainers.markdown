# DevContainers

Development Containers are a great way to setup a complete dev environment based on container technology and visual studio code. It was developed by microsoft and is hosted by github in various public repositories.   

Getting started is rather easy - microsoft provides ready to use templates. When you're more familiar you can extend them.
