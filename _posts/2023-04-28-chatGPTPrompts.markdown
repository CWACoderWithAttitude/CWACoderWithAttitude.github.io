# ChatGPT Prompts

Rowan Cheung ( @rowancheung ) posted a list of ChatGPT Prompts to tackle questions in seconds instead of hours. I think this dramatic speedup is a bold claim. But it just sounds to promising.

I can hardly solve my own simple questions so i deciced to memorize those Prompts. To be very clear - those stem from a mind much more capabale than mine - Rowan i hope you don't mind posting this here as a cheatsheet. One i can remember quite well.

This is his [prompting cheat sheet](https://t.co/4so8jC6Dpq). Actually i was so amazed by the first 3 prompts that i started creating my cheat sheet. Only to learn Rowan creted one already - lesson learned: read the whole story before start typing ;-)
