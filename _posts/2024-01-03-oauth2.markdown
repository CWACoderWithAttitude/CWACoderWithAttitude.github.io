# Terms used when talking OAuth2


| Term                     | Meaning                                                                                  |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Resource Owner           | Person really owning the data (emails, bitcoin, bankaccount...)                          |
| Client                   | Application that wat to access your data on your behalf and perform actions on your data |
| Authorization Server     | System to consent to allowing the client to act on your data                             |
|                          | (accounts.google.com, idp.insurance.com...))                                             |
| Resource Server          | API / System holding the data                                                            |
| Authorization Grant      | Proof that the user has answered `yes` in the consent dialog                             |
| Redirect URI             | The Authorization redirects to the client app. This URI says where exactly.              |
| Access Token             | What the client really wants/needs - this token finally allows accessing the data        |
| OAuth Scope(s) / Consent | Action/permission the client asks for in the first place                                 |
|                          | The Authorization Server maintains a list of valid scopes                                |
| Back channel             | highly secure (backend app)                                                              |
| Front channel channel    | less secure (browser app)                                                                |

> Quite often authorization and resource server are identical - but that's no requirement.

The scope send in step 2.c is used to build the consent dialog

## Types of Authorization Grants:

1. Code : Most common one: Code Grant

## OAuth Flow

1. Client: Button: Connect with Apple/Google/M$
1. Call Autorization Server and provides a) Redirect URI: client.com/callback and b) Response type: code and c) Scope

   Response type specifies which type of Authorization Grant we want.

1. Asks/prompte user to login and consent to the permissions requested by the Client
1. If User consents: Authorization Server redirects the user the the URI given in step 2
   and sends an authorization code with this redirect
1. Client now uses this authorization code to go back to the authorization server and says: Great, thx for the authorization code. But what i really really is an Access Token (and swap the code for a token).
1. Authorization Server verifies this code
1. Client uses Access Token to access data on Resource Server (contacts.apple.com,...)
