VS Code is great editor - colon.   
There're ways to make it even better:
* by using fonts better suited for coding - like [Install Fira Code Font](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode/wiki/VS-Code-Instructions)
* and enabling ligatures
  ```json
  "editor.fontFamily": "Fira Code",
  "editor.fontLigatures": true
  ```
  A detailed description can be found on the Fira Codde website shown above.
  * For smooth editing install `Disable Ligatures` plugin   
  This translates the cool ligatures into editable characters.
