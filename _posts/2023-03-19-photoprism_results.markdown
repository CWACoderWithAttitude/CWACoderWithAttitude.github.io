# PhotoPrism App

In yesterdays post i wanted to try out PhotoPrism to dig through my images. The index process worked last night to index > 15k images and ~1100 videos.   
It identified a lot of places, identified a bunch labels and much more.   
This is a neat approach to dig your media files. Prism uses [Tensorflow to extract meta data from images and videos](https://docs.photoprism.app/developer-guide/technologies/tensorflow/).   
As always when dealing with AI the results can be `unexpected` :-) 

Conclusion: I'm convinced this is a very convenient approach to tame your media files. To get most from it one would have to get a deeper understandind how meta data extraction works under the hood.   
I'll give this another try when there is more time.
