Hi,

these pages serve as scratchpad on steroids. Most pages just contain links i don't want to loose.

Or they contain code snippets - maybe i should move them to github ghists...

Ideas, opinions, mistakes and errors are mine. They do not necessarily reflect my employers ideas. My employer [Unterschied &amp; Macher](https://www.unterschiedundmacher.rocks/adobe-experience-manager/aem-team-upgrade) - gives home to a bunch of most exceptional colleagues.

They foster new ideas. They encourage me (and maybe you) to go beyond your limits!
