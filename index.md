Hi,

these pages serve as scratchpad on steroids. Most pages just contain links i don't want to loose.<br>
Or they contain code snippets - maybe i should move them to github ghists...<br>

However: Ideas, opinions, mistakes and errors are mine. Stuff shown here does not necessarily reflect my employers ideas.<br>
[Unterschied &amp; Macher](https://www.unterschiedundmacher.rocks/adobe-experience-manager/aem-team-upgrade) gives home to a bunch of most exceptional colleagues. Browse to our website and get yourself an idea.

They foster new ideas. They encourage me (and maybe you) to go beyond your limits!
