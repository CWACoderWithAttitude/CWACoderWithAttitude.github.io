Hi,

these pages serve as scratchpad on steroids. Most pages just contain links i don't want to loose.<br>
Or they contain code snippets - maybe i should move them to github ghists...<br>

However: Ideas, opinions, mistakes and errors are mine. Stuff shown here does not necessarily reflect my employers ideas.<br>
